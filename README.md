## Overview



## Background

Managing customer waitlists during peak hours poses a significant challenge for restaurants. Traditional systems, such as physical queues and SMS notifications, often result in inefficiencies, miscommunication, and customer dissatisfaction.<br><br>
Additionally, the lack of engaging options during waiting periods further detracts from the overall dining experience. As restaurants increasingly embrace digital tools like QR codes for menus, integrating waitlist management into this technological shift is a natural progression to improve operations and customer engagement.
